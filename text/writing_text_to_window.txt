MOUSE DOWN DEGREES OF ACTION
1. User is beginning to drawing sth (can't really tell until move)
2. Is trying to finish up text
3. A double click

How do we distinguish? 1 - bDrawing==False, 2 - bDrawing==True 3 - 

MOUSE UP DEGREES OF ACTION
1. User has completed drawing a shape
2. User has started inputing text after drawing out text box
3. A clickup from the downclick for finish up text or from a double click

How do we distinguish between an undirected click on the screen and an upclick from finishing to draw. Mouse down reacts to bWriting which is turned on during mouseup (the mouseup that happens when user completes drawing the rectangle for the edit)

MOUSE MOVE DEGREES OF ACTION
1. Casual movement. 
2. Movement while drawing out a shapes

I think i oughta have a system for managing how things are changeing to i can program better. the variables i have right now are i think too many. i need to figure out how to many logical complexity. there seems to be a mine of experience to dig here. Now that i'm integrating a new feature into my initial program, i want to know how it is the actions am taking affect the conditions for other actions to take place. that i think is the thing that isn't quite obviously clear to me. i think a kind of large display would be quite very useful. For example, at the end of each mouse case, how are the actions likely to be taken by the computer. what i need is some larger display - this can be at the moment accomplished using a display or an app like photoshop.
