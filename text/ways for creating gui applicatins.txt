    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/drawing-with-the-mouses - this saved me a lot of effort.
i don't understand what an instance is. i'm assumingn it is sth used by the os. i think there could be a template for creating a windowed application so that one doesn't need to think a lot when trying to create a windowed application.
