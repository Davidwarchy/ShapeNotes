mouse move:
  if active:
    clear canvas

how to draw a shape.
####################################################
draw circle when the use clicks and drags the mouse
create a rectangle in which the shape is to exist
set a boolean that indicates whether we are drawing or not

mouse down
    set first point
    set drawing active
  
mouse move
    check if left button is down & also whether drawing is set to active
    get the coordinates.
    get them to rectangle & validate the rectangle
      rcTarget is the rectangle on which we are drawing the free shape. Why can't it be a variable local to the Windows Procedre function? I think it could be if, after the left mouse button is lifted we transferred this temporary shape to a new shape, whose pointer we added to the shapes forward_list. this could work also.
    send paint message to window
    
mouse up
    set drawing inactive so we don't draw any shape on mouse move
    add drawn shape to shapes
    
paint
    paint all the shapes.
    

problems
1. $initial bits are quite random
     resolved after resolving 2
2. $the trail left by the left-bottom edge of the rectangle bounding the shape
     both one and two were caused by the reset that is done when we free up the memory using GlobalFree.
     when GlobalFree is used after we restore an image, only one small dot is how for each image. 
     what was hapening before was that we were resetting the first 64bits of the bitmap to random numbers, thus the random colors at the bottomleft of teh image.
3. the loss of capacity to repair canvas from previous images when size seems to exceed a particular size
     this seemed to resolve after resolving 2
4. stops painting after some time
5. tiny dot at the bottom left of the image. 
   the fact that this happens in the first image tells me that it is sth only occuring once and not any other time; in other words, only the first bitmap we create and draw
