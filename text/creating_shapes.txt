how to draw a shape.
####################################################
draw circle when the use clicks and drags the mouse
create a rectangle in which the shape is to exist
set a boolean that indicates whether we are drawing or not

mouse down
    set first point
    set drawing active
  
mouse move
    check if left button is down & also whether drawing is set to active
    get the coordinates.
    get them to rectangle & validate the rectangle
      rcTarget is the rectangle on which we are drawing the free shape. Why can't it be a variable local to the Windows Procedre function? I think it could be if, after the left mouse button is lifted we transferred this temporary shape to a new shape, whose pointer we added to the shapes forward_list. this could work also.
    send paint message to window
    
mouse up
    set drawing inactive so we don't draw any shape. 
    add drawn shape to shapes
    
paint
