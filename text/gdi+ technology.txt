Stuff I'm finding out about the graphics headers in mingw
  including gdiplus includes all the header files, that is all the wdi classes mentioned in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_gdiplus/
  those are the classes defining the interaction between the program and the grahics devices.
